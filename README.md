One-to-Many Multi-view
=
This repository contains the code for our paper "Multiview Representation Learning with One-to-Many Dynamic Relationships".

Requirment
=
pytoch>=1.3.1  
python>=3.7.4  
numpy>=1.16.5  
scikit-learn>=0.21.3  
scipy>=1.3.1  

Dataset
=
The datasets used in the paper can be obtained through the following links [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gKAcKx3Gu2zzJieXfg7r1Dm4dveqGH84/view?usp=sharing) or  [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1a1BVH26zIcer_Qa8f-BbrA?pwd=g84z) (code: g84z)

Usage
=
The code includes:  
* an example implementation of the model on the Reuters dataset
* an example clustering task  

You can get the following output by running multi_view_main.py  
(modify the dataset path in the multi_view_data.py)
